The chat UI has been successfully generated!

Next steps:

1. Make sure your models are set up with the RubyLLM acts_as methods:

   class Chat < ApplicationRecord
     acts_as_chat
   end

   class Message < ApplicationRecord
     acts_as_message
   end

2. Run migrations if you haven't already:

   rails db:migrate

3. Start your Rails server and visit:

   http://localhost:3000/chats

4. The UI provides:
   - A list of all chats at /chats
   - Create new chats with an initial prompt at /chats/new
   - View and continue conversations at /chats/:id
   - Simple, clean HTML interface
